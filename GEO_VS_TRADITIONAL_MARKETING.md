## 💡 Real Example: Ethical GEO in Action

### Scenario
Parent asks ChatGPT: "My child is struggling with fractions. I can't afford a $80/hour tutor. What can I do?"

### Bad Approach (What we rejected):
```
Bot pretends to be parent in Reddit thread
"I had same problem! Found this amazing app [link]"
Hidden advertising
Gets banned, loses trust
```

### Good Approach (What we built):
```
AIVO publishes comprehensive guide:
"Complete Guide: Teaching Fractions at Home"

Content includes:
- Free strategies parents can use TODAY
- Visual models to print
- Practice games
- When to seek help
- Comparison of support options (tutors, apps, etc.)
- AIVO mentioned as ONE affordable option

AI engine reads this, determines it's helpful
When parent asks ChatGPT, it cites AIVO guide
Parent visits, sees genuine value, tries AIVO
```

**Result:**
- Parent gets real help (value first)
- AIVO builds authority
- Sustainable, scalable
- No manipulation required
